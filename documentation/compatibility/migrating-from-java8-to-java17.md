# 🚀 Migrating from Java 8 to Java 17

Migrating a project from Java 8 to Java 17 is **not as simple as just upgrading your JDK** and changing your `pom.xml`. There are major language, API, tooling, and compatibility changes that require careful evaluation.

---

## ❌ Not Just "Upgrade and Compile"

You cannot simply:

- Install JDK 17
- Update `<java.version>` in your `pom.xml`
- Run your project and assume everything works

Instead, a full migration process is recommended.

---

## ✅ Key Differences to Consider

### 1. 🧠 Language Features Introduced (Java 9–17)

- Java 9: Module System (`module-info.java`)
- Java 10: `var` keyword
- Java 14: `record`, enhanced `switch` (preview)
- Java 15+: `sealed`, `pattern matching`, etc.

These may break older code or tools that don't support newer constructs.

---

### 2. ⚙️ JDK Internal Changes

- Deprecated or removed APIs (e.g., JavaFX, `javaws`)
- Changed default garbage collectors and performance behaviors
- Changes to internal classes and reflection behavior

---

### 3. 📦 Dependency Compatibility

- Some libraries might not yet support Java 17
- Frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, etc. may require upgrades
- Consider using tools like `jdeps` to detect JDK internal API usage

---

### 4. 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Required

- Compilation success ≠ runtime safety
- JVM behavior changes can cause subtle regressions
- Thorough unit, integration, and performance testing is essential

---

### 5. 🔧 External Tools and Infrastructure

- Jenkins agents must support Java 17
- Docker images and CI/CD runners should be updated
- Spark clusters must run on Java 17 if targeting it

---

## ✅ Recommended Migration Steps

### 🔁 Example: Migrating from Java 8 to Java 17 in Cluster Environments

If your cluster (e.g. Spark) is currently running Java 8 and you're transitioning to Java 17, follow a **phased strategy** to ensure compatibility:

#### 🔧 Set up dual compatibility testing:
- Add a Maven build profile for Java 17 (optional for early testing)
- Continue building with `--release=8` using JDK 17 to maintain backward compatibility

#### 🚶 Migrate in stages:
1. **Start with JDK 17**, but keep `<release>8</release>` to simulate Java 8 target compatibility
2. Gradually bump the release version:
    - Move to 11 → validate
    - Move to 17 → only once **all cluster nodes** support it

#### 🧪 Validate cluster readiness:
- Upgrade **dev/test cluster nodes** to Java 17
- Run staging Spark jobs under Java 17 to catch runtime issues early

#### 📦 Update your `pom.xml` with `--release` option:
```xml
<properties>
  <java.version>17</java.version>
</properties>
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.11.0</version>
      <configuration>
        <release>${java.version}</release>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```
Using `<release>` ensures consistent language and bytecode targeting in a single property, especially useful for cross-version builds.


1. **Check Java 17 support** in your dependencies
2. **Upgrade JDK** in your dev, build, and deployment environments
3. **Update `pom.xml`**:
   ```xml
   <properties>
     <java.version>17</java.version>
     <maven.compiler.source>${java.version}</maven.compiler.source>
     <maven.compiler.target>${java.version}</maven.compiler.target>
   </properties>
   ```
4. **Rebuild and run all tests**
5. **Deploy to a staging environment** and verify behavior

## 🧠 Tips

- Use Maven Enforcer Plugin to **fail fast** if the wrong JDK is used
- Use `jdeps` or tools like `revapi` to inspect compatibility
- Read the [Java 17 Release Notes](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/) and [Migration Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/migrate/) from Oracle

## ✅ Summary

| Task                                | Required? |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| Install Java 17 locally             | ✅        |
| Update `pom.xml`                    | ✅        |
| Upgrade dependencies                | ✅        |
| Run all tests                       | ✅        |
| Check compatibility with CI/CD     | ✅        |
| Ensure runtime matches target JVM  | ✅        |

A successful migration means not just compiling — but **running safely and reliably** in production under Java 17.
